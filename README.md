###__Purpose of this Study__###

The purpose of the study is to investigate the relationship among the food we consume, our emotions and our use of social media. 

###__Procedures__###

In this study, you will first be asked to complete a questionnaire (which takes about 5 minutes) about your personal information, diet habits and social media usage. 

After you complete the questionnaire, you will be asked to provide us daily information on your meal and emotion between Nov 21th, 2016 and Dec 11th, 2016, which lasts for a total of 3 weeks. A short questionnaire (which takes about less than 1 minute to answer) will be sent to your phone three times a day during the above time period, in which you will describe on what you eat and how you feel at that moment. You will also have an option of uploading a picture of your meal in the questionnaire. 

The information that you have made public on your social media account (e.g. moment on Wechat, timeline on Facebook or Instagram) during the above time period will also be collected for the purpose of data analysis. 

###__Participant Requirements__###

We are primarily looking for fulltime undergraduates or postgraduates at HKUST or HKU that already have a social media account (e.g. Wechat, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram). 

###__Risks__###

The risks and discomfort associated with participation in this study are no greater than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during using mobile phones to type or take photos.

###__Benefits__###

There may be no personal benefit from your participation in the study but the knowledge received may be of value to humanity.
